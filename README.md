    <h2>White Paper</h2>
    <h3>"Because Someone Has to Speak to the Blockchain Manager"</h3>
    <p><strong>Version:</strong> Who even cares anymore</p>

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>KAREN Coin is not here to save the world, disrupt DeFi, or build the future of finance. It’s here to complain. Loudly. On-chain. With style.</p>

    <h3>Why Karen?</h3>
    <p>Because every ecosystem needs a middle-aged rage machine in yoga pants asking where the manager is. Karen Coin gives you nothing but makes you feel like you're owed everything.</p>

    <h3>Features (Kinda)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No staking. No farming. No fake roadmaps.</li>
      <li>100% Attitude. We're here to complain about your whitepaper.</li>
      <li>DAO? LOL. We don’t need consensus. We need someone fired.</li>
      <li>Spreads by yelling. You’ll hear us before you see us.</li>
      <li>No Airdrops. Ever. Go buy it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chain Drama</h3>
    <p>KAREN Coin was almost on Berachain until Berachain gave us attitude. So now we're on whatever chain we feel like: Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Maybe Cardano just to piss people off.</p>

    <h3>What This Is NOT</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not financial advice</li>
      <li>Not financial anything</li>
      <li>Not serious</li>
      <li>Not regulated</li>
      <li>Not sorry</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t be nice — be right.</li>
      <li>If you see a problem, escalate it.</li>
      <li>No memes under 7/10 quality.</li>
      <li>Haircut appointments > dev updates.</li>
      <li>If you DM the devs, expect a Yelp review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Transaction Fees (Because Karen Said So)</h3>
    <p>Every transaction includes a 0.0001% tax — because Karen deserves it. Half goes to the original Karen (you). Half goes back to you, because you were almost nice for once. It’s called emotional damage interest.</p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You buy something on-chain.</li>
      <li>KAREN Coin says: “Excuse me, sweetie. Where’s my cut?”</li>
      <li>0.0001% is routed to the Official Karen Wallet™.</li>
      <li>KAREN posts a passive-aggressive tweet about how you should be thankful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Official Policy</h3>
    <p>“If I don’t get paid for doing nothing, what even is the point of Web3?” – Karen, 2025</p>

    <h3>Tokenomics (Still Doesn’t Matter)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Total Supply: Whatever.</li>
      <li>Dev Wallet: Karen took it.</li>
      <li>Burn Address: Karen complained until it was removed.</li>
      <li>Liquidity: Emotionally unstable, but locked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tip Karen 0.0001% per transaction</li>
      <li>Not argue (she’ll win anyway)</li>
      <li>Accept random bonus KARENs when she’s feeling generous</li>
      <li>Apologize even when it’s not your fault</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Warning</h3>
    <p>KAREN Coin is not refundable, not nice, and not leaving the store until she gets that discount.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>KAREN earns 0.0001% of every transaction. You earn 0.0001% too, because maybe you're not completely useless. Everyone else? They're lucky we didn’t charge more.</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>KAREN Coin is a decentralized tantrum on-chain. It exists because we were bored, bitter, and caffeinated. If you don't like it, good — that means it's working.</p>
